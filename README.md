# IS211_Final_Project-Book_Catalogue
Book Catalogue


Based on the Microblog example used in Miguel Grinberg's Flask Mega-Tutorial,
I attempted to create the Book Catalogue as the final project. I ran the program
using a Windows terminal with the "flask run" command. I set up the environment 
using the ".flaskenv" python file and activated it in the terminal.

The Python packages I installed are:
  1. Flask-WTF
  2. Flask-SQLAlchemy
  3. Flask-Login
  4. Flask-Migrate

I tried to follow the separation of concerns principle by separating the functionalities
into several files. I have made corrections to the code in the "Register" html template and
the "Register" view function. I am not sure what is causing the "Internal Server Error" error
message on the login page.
